# Yellow_Tracker
This project uses OpenCV and Pygame to simulate a robot that tracks and follows a yellow object in real time. The webcam captures video, applies color detection to identify the object's position, and updates the robot's movement accordingly. Pygame visualizes the robot's movement, creating an interactive object-tracking simulation.
